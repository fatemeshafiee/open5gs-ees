</p>
<p>
  This fork of Open5GS introduces enhancements for advanced 5G core analytics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>UPF Event Exposure Service (EES)</strong><br>
    Adds functionality for the User Plane Function (UPF) to expose traffic-related events through 3GPP-compliant service.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> SMF Subscriptions to NWDAF </strong><br>
    Enables the Session Management Function (SMF) to subscribe to the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Abnormal UE Handling </strong><br>
     Upon receiving NWDAF notifications, the SMF can identify abnormal User Equipment (UEs) and automatically release their PDU sessions, helping maintain optimal network performance.
  </li>
</ul>
